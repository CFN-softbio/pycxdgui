Some notes for things to do:
- kill a pyqtgraph window (how to kill ref to window, where are refs saved globally?)
- plot window center 
- add color scales
- method to click and receive point (one time)
- replace circavg and qphiavg with skbeam version

dependencies:
- installing latest pyqtgraph (in case current version doesn't work, color map error etc):
$ git clone https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph.git
$ cd pyqtgraph
$ git branch develop #(make sure to have the development branch selected)
$ python setup.py install #(you may need to be root if you don't have a conda environment)
- pyqtgraph, PyQt5, numpy, scipy, scikit-beam
